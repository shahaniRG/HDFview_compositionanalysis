"# HDFview_compositionanalysis" 

Load .hdf5 file and calculate the composition at equilibrium. 

First, crop the area you already know the composition (at equilibrium) and calculate the intensity.

This intensity can be used to calculate the intensity at different temperature.

The intensity can be converted to composition, you may need to solve the simultaneous equations.
